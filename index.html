	<br><u><b>Capt Batra’s Quotes:</b></u>

 
<ul>
<li>“Either I will come back after hoisting the Tricolour (Indian flag), or I will come back wrapped in it, but I will be back for sure.”</li>
<li>“Yeh Dil Maange More! (My heart asks for more!)”</li>
<li>“Don’t worry about us, pray for your safety.”
Capt Batra’s last words were,  “Durga Mata Ki Jai!” (“Victory to Goddess Durga!”)”, the battle-cry of his Regiment.</li>
<li>When a terrorist’s bullet meant for him had struck his man behind him during his first posting in Sopore in Jammu and Kashmir: “Didi, it was meant for me and I lost my man”, he had told his elder sister over the phone.</li>
<li>After the victory at peak 5140, Capt Batra had spoken to his father, Shri G.L Batra and said,” Daddy, I’ve captured.’ His voice was unclear and his father asked him to speak again. ‘Oh Daddy, I’ve captured the enemy’s post. I’m OK, I’m OK”. His father had replied, “Bete, I’m proud of you, may God bless you to carry on your task there”.</li></ul>
